Tier 5: Stability Estimates
---------------------------

[T 5.1 : ε comm]
ε_ab = |[L_a, L_b]|
ε = max ε_ab

[T 5.2 : BCH err]
log( exp(A(r)) exp(A(s)) ) - (A(r) + A(s)) approx 1/2 [A(r), A(s)]
Bounded by O(ε |r| |s|)

[T 5.3 : RSTR rel approx]
RSTR (r)⊤ RSTR (s) − RSTR (s − r) ≤ C ε |r|1 |s|1 + O(ε2 )

Interpretation:
The failure of relative position equivariance grows QUADRATICALLY with the distance 
between tokens (|r| * |s|) if the commutativity constraint is relaxed (ε > 0).
This explains why "approximate" STRING models fail on OOD shifts.
