Tier 8': Quantified Robustness
------------------------------

[T 8′ .7 : IRspec (f )]
IR_spec(f) = E_Delta [ sup | Pi_act Rsp(r)^T Rsp(r + Delta) Pi_act - Pi_act RSTR(Delta) | ]

[T 8′ .12 : Shift-Lipschitz]
|R_target - R_train| <= L * IR_spec

[T 8′ .23 : No benefit when commuting (sharpness)]
If [L_a, L_b] = 0 AND Psp is structured:
Then ε = 0.
Then IR_spec(f) = 0.
Then |R_target - R_train| = 0.
Gap is zero.

Conclusion:
STRING's exact constraints ([L, L]=0) mathematically guarantee a generalization gap of zero
for translational shifts, provided the model architecture respects the group structure.
This is a property not shared by any learned approximation.
